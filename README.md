# CVE Tracker

This project is a simple web application designed to maintain a watchlist of CVEs of interest. The use case is for new CVEs that have little publicly available information. This web application queries the AttackerKB API to pull the Attacker Value and Exploitability assessments. This application requires an account with AttackerKB.

## Instructions

This web application requires a fully functioning LAMP stack and a few PHP modules to function. Install these dependencies first.

```bash
sudo apt install apache2 php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql php-curl mysql-server
```

Clone this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/joonhohw/CVE-Tracker.git
```

Next, you must set up MySQL for the application. Start a MySQL session as the root user.

```bash
sudo mysql -u root
```

Create a new database for the application.

```mysql
CREATE DATABASE watchlist;
```

Create a new user for the `watchlist` database. Replace the items in `<>` with your own values.

```mysql
CREATE USER '<username>'@'localhost' identified by '<password>';
```

Grant all privileges to the new user on the `watchlist` database.

```mysql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON watchlist . * to '<username>'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Create a table to be used by the application. NOTE: If you do not copy+paste this exact command, the table name and column name may not match with the PHP code, requiring further modification in `index.php`, `delete.php`, `update.php`, `add-cve.php`, and `includes/a_config.php`.

```mysql
CREATE TABLE watchlist (id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(20), attackerkb_id VARCHAR(50), date_added DATE, last_updated DATE, attacker_value FLOAT, exploitability FLOAT);
```

Add the username, password, and AttackerKB API key in the `includes/a_config.php` file.

Run the server.

If you want the data to update regularly without user interaction, create a cronjob to run the `update.php` file.
